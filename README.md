# Elon-Doge
This project attempts to determine whether tweets posted by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk have an effect on the stock prices for 'meme' cryptocurrency 'Dogecoin.' In the past decade, social media has become incredibly prevalent and widespread for people of all ages, some of the most popular platforms belonging to just Meta (Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp). However, one of the most influential is Twitter. It is an app where users upload short messages to their profile, each having a limit of 280 characters, although most 'tweets' are below 100 characters or even a couple words. Because of the way tweets are designed, users often treat tweets as 'status updates' and tweet anything clever or interesting that goes in their lives. As a result, Twitter has become a platform for celebrities to share their opinions, seen by millions and millions of people. From your friend to the President of the United States, Twitter is truly influential. In particular, Elon Musk tweets multiple times a day, and due to his billionaire status and online charm, his tweets with 'doge' may have an affect on dogecoin prices. Sentiment analysis will be applied on Elon's 'doge' tweets to collect the polarities from the tweets, which will be plotted against the difference between Dogecoin's closing price and the day before's, matched by date.
